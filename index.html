				<h2>What is the Pictures of the Year competition?</h2>
				<p>Pictures of the Year, started in spring of 1944 as the First Annual Fifty-Print Exhibition by Cliff
					Edom at the University of Missouri. At the time, its purpose was “to pay tribute to those press
					photographers and newspapers which, despite tremendous war-time difficulties, are doing a splendid
					job to provide an opportunity for photographers of the nation to meet in open competition; and to
					compile and preserve… a collection of the best in current, home-front press pictures”. </p>

				<p>The next few years welcomed the beginning of a series of changes in name and scope that also mark the
					genesis of the competition’s evolution as society and the industry transformed. In 1948 the
					Fifty-Print Exhibition became the News Picture of the Year Contest when magazine photographers were
					invited to participate. When the University of Missouri and the National Press Photographers’
					Association (NPPA) merged contests in 1957, the competition became Pictures of the Year (POY). Known
					today as POYi (Pictures of the Year International), it is one of the oldest photojournalism
					contests. Thousands of images are entered by photographers from around the world. (<a
						href="https://www.poy.org/history.html">Pictures of the Year | 77th Annual Competition |
						History</a>)</p>

				<p>Reframing Photographs investigates the Pictures of the Year competition archives — photos and
					information
					about winners — between 1984 and 2004. Phase one digs into the data about the POY winners to
					understand
					the representation of women and men within the archives.</p>
				<p><strong>Why 1984 to 2004?</strong> This timeframe was a period of immense change both for the
					competition, the publishing
					industry and systems surrounding photojournalism. It was, according to Bill Garrett, former Editor
					of
					National Geographic, “the Oscars of photojournalism” (source).</p>

				<p class="disclaimer">Please note: The dataset for this project was sourced from the Pictures of the
					Year competition yet upon analysis, data was found to be missing in addition to errors and many
					inconsistencies. <strong>Not sure what else to add?</strong></p>

				<h2>The Jury</h2>
				<p>Well-respected scholars, photographers, editors, and
					designers have typically invited to be on the jury. As the competition continues to evolve to
					reflect the industry, the jury evolves as well. Recruitment and selection of jury members
					is a subjective process and an art.</p>
				<p>Bill Kuykendall:</p>

				<blockquote>Every judge must be able to speak authoritatively and convincingly using specifics and not
					just feelings. My NPPA liaisons and I put a lot of effort into identifying prospective judges who
					had the right combination of processional experience as [photographers] and editors and the ability
					to articulate the virtues and shortcomings of entries. Temperament is another quality. The [panel]
					requires individuals who 'play well' with others.</blockquote>

				<h2>The Photographers (Award Winners)</h2>
				<p>For many years, photo competitions offered the rare outlet for photographers to have their work
					rewarded and recognized with the hope their work is seen by people who hire and/or publish
					photography. Winning an award in POY tended to be a valuable stepping-stone for photographers’
					careers. Newspaper and magazine photographers also saw the Pictures of the Year competition as a way
					to earn respect from the ‘word people’ who ran their papers. As photography gained more respect,
					winning awards gave photographers more bragging rights, giving many photographers a type of fame and
					prestige within and out of the photojournalism community. Most were men, giving them more and highly
					coveted assignments and greater earning power (source?).</p>

				<h2>The Awards</h2>
				<p>Winning an award from the Pictures of the Year competition offered fuel for marketing and brand value
					for organizations. According to Bill Kuykendall, “publishers saw contests as a way to burnish their
					publications’ reputation. Picture editors saw them as a way to develop and motivate their staff”.
					Howard Chapnick of Black Star and Bob Gilka of <em>National Geographic</em> recognized the value of
					entering POY and other photo competitions, encouraging their photographers to enter and providing
					the time and resources to do so. Winning gave organizations promotional capital: Their staffs were
					among the best visual storytellers in the world. </p>
				<p>According to David Rees, the scale and scope of the Pictures of the Year changed dramatically during
					Bill Kuykendall’s tenure. The number of entries increased to tens of thousands, [increase in
