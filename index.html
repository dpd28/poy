			<h2>A deep dive into twenty years of the Pictures of the Year competition clarifies what women already knew

				<h2>What is the Pictures of the Year competition?</h2>
				<p>Pictures of the Year, started in the spring of 1944 as the First Annual Fifty-Print Exhibition by
					Cliff Edom at the University of Missouri. At the time, its purpose was “to pay tribute to those
					press photographers and newspapers which, despite tremendous war-time difficulties, are doing a
					splendid job to provide an opportunity for photographers of the nation to meet in open competition;
					and to compile and preserve… a collection of the best in current, home-front press pictures”. The
					competition was, according to Bill Garrett, former Editor of <em>National Geographic</em>,“the
					Oscars of photojournalism” (1).</p>

				<p>The next few years welcomed the beginning of a series of changes in name and scope that also mark the
					genesis of the competition’s evolution as society and the industry transformed. In 1948 the
					Fifty-Print Exhibition became the News Picture of the Year Contest when magazine photographers were
					invited to participate. When the University of Missouri and the National Press Photographers’
					Association (NPPA) merged contests in 1957, the competition became Pictures of the Year (POY). Known
					today as POYi (Pictures of the Year International), it is one of the oldest photojournalism
					contests. Thousands of images are entered by visual journalists from around the world. (<a

				<p>This project is a case study and the first phase of a longer-term exploration and investigation of
					the Pictures of the Year competition archives, including data about photographs entered, jurors and
					winners. Phase one digs into the data made available by the University of Missouri and the Pictures
					of the Year competition to understand the representation of women and men within the archives
					between 1984 and 2004.</p>
				<p><strong>Why 1984 to 2004?</strong> This timeframe was a period of immense change for the
					competition, the publishing industry and systems surrounding photojournalism. It was a time when
					Google was in its nascency and before social media mushroomed. It was also a time of seismic
					evolution for photojournalism.
				</p>
				<p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: This is the first phase of a longer-term investigation and
					visualization of the Pictures of the Year International (POYi) archives. The findings for this phase
					are limited to the years between 1984 and 2004 and cannot be generalized for the entire competition.
					Results should be viewed and treated with caution as the data source was found to have numerous
					errors and inconsistencies in addition to missing or unknown information.

				<h2>The Jury</h2>
				<p>Well-respected scholars, photographers, editors, and designers have typically been invited to be on
					the jury. As the competition continues to evolve to reflect the industry, the jury evolves as well.
					Recruitment and selection of jury members is a subjective process and an art.
				</p>
				<p>Bill Kuykendall:</p>

				<blockquote>Every judge must be able to speak authoritatively and convincingly using specifics and not
					just feelings. My NPPA liaisons and I put a lot of effort into identifying prospective judges who
					had the right combination of professional experience as [photographers] and editors and the ability
					to articulate the virtues and shortcomings of entries. Temperament is another quality. The [panel]
					requires individuals who 'play well' with others.</blockquote>

				<h2>The Photographers</h2>
				<p>For many years, photo competitions offered the rare outlet for photographers to have their work
					rewarded and recognized with the hope their work would be seen by people who hire and/or publish
					photography. Winning an award in POY tended to be a valuable stepping-stone for photographers’
					careers and could be key considerations for pay raises for staff photographers. Newspaper and
					magazine photographers also saw the Pictures of the Year competition as a way to earn respect from
					the ‘word people’. As photography gained more respect, winning awards gave photographers more
					bragging rights and a type of fame and prestige within and out of the photojournalism community.

				<h2>The Awards</h2>
				<p>Pictures of the Year changed dramatically between 1984 and 2004. The number of entries increased
					steadily to tens of thousands and in 1987, the judging process shifted from viewing prints mounted
					on boards to viewing slides. It was a period of immense growth and change for the competition. It
					switched to digital format in 2001.</p>
				<p>Winning an award from the Pictures of the Year competition offered fuel for marketing and brand value
					for organizations. According to Bill Kuykendall, “publishers saw contests as a way to burnish their
					publications’ reputation. Picture editors saw them as a way to develop and motivate their staff”.
					The awards offered a concrete metric for directors of photography and editors to justify budgets and
					for some, increase the diversity of hiring. Howard Chapnick of Black Star and Bob Gilka of
					<em>National
						Geographic</em> recognized the value of entering POY and other photo competitions, encouraging
					their photographers to enter and providing the time and resources to do so. <strong>Winning gave
						organizations
						promotional capital</strong>: Their staffs were among the best visual storytellers in the world.

				<p>As women were busting stereotypes and prejudice, there were <a

					for the dramatic shift in the economics and ethics of photojournalism between 1990 and 2000. Using
					the Yugoslav Wars as the background, Good and Lowe share how within ten years, film shifted to
					digital and auto-focus cameras. Independent photo agencies such as Sipa, Sygma, and Gamma
					disappeared. Corbis and Getty ate up agencies such as SABA, Katz IPG and Rapho, significantly
					discounting stock photography and migrating images online, while also distributing contracts
					impinging on photographers’ livelihood. Similar to newspaper publishers creating publishing
					monopolies, Corbis and Getty created market conditions where the medium-sized photo agencies could
					not compete.</p>

				<h2>Freelance Photographers</h2>
				<p>Naturally, as the more traditional model and markets for photojournalism showed signs of collapse,
					the traditional outlets for publishing photojournalism also diminished. Newspaper jobs
					have <a
						href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/employment-trends-in-newspaper-publishing-and-other-media-1990-2016.htm">declined
						dramatically since the 1990s</a>. Not surprisingly, there has
					been a <a href="https://work.chron.com/being-photographer-high-demand-22984.html">steady increase of
						freelance photographers</a> over time. Given these conditions, it would be
					natural to assume freelancers would be winning a greater percentage of awards each year.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="chart freelancetotal">
				<div class="chartExplainer">
					<h3>Percent of Award Winners Who are Freelance Photographers</h3>
					<p>Between 1984 and 2004, a total of 477 awards were given to freelance photojournalists with a
						significant percentage peak in the mid-to-late 90s.</p>
				</div><!-- end chartExplainer -->
				<figure id="freelance">
				</figure>
				<div class="chartNotes">
					<p>These percentages were derived from award winners designated as freelance or
						independent. This may or may not include freelancers who were contracted by wire services or
						photo agencies. Awards associated with an agency, wire service, newspaper or magazine,
						were counted with the publishing outlets.</p>
				</div>
			</div><!-- end chart -->
			<div class="text">
				<p> Yet, beginning in 1999, the number of awards
					given to freelancers shows a decline. Why? A few possibilities:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></span> <strong>After a split with the National
							Press Photographers Association (NPPA)</strong> in 2001,
						POY started to charge entry fees for the first time in its history.</li>
					<li><span class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></span> <strong>2000 to
							2004 brought major world events</strong> including the dot com bubble, Enron, 9/11 terrorist
						attacks, the War on Terror, the War in Afghanistan, and several coups, conflicts and civil wars
						around the world. Events considered “news” for U.S. publishing outlets meant sending
						photographers overseas to cover them which brought resource and safety concerns. Most freelance
						photographers did not have such resources unless contracted by major publishing outlets in the
						U.S. or Europe. It could be that during this time, publishing titles were devoting greater
						amounts of staff resources to major news events.
					</li>
					<li><span class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></span><strong>By the end of 2004, newspaper photography
							staffs were still relatively robust</strong>. Many could still count on the benefits of
						full-time
						employment while also having the resources and time to publish meaningful work. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>So even though 2004 also marked the beginning of a <a
						href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/" target="_blank">sizeable
						decline in local newspapers and the appearance of news deserts</a>, the most <a
						href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2013-05-30-chi-chicago-sun-times-photo-20130530-story.html">catastrophic

				<h2>Why Are Women Still A Minority?</h2>
				<p>This glimpse into the Pictures of the Year competition reinforces what many of us already know:
					<strong>photojournalism is a male-dominated profession but, it has never been exclusively
						male</strong>. Women have and continue to confront circumstances, rise up to meet challenges and
					address societal expectations unique to their gender. Still, many women have defied stereotypes,
					challenges, circumstances and expectations to produce some of the most compelling photographs of our
					time.
				</p>
				<h2 style="color:red;">[Add images by women here]</h2>
				<p>Women have endured, they continue to have a voice in the profession. So, why are women still a
					minority and
					“<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2017.1282831"
						title="Research by Westcott Campbell &amp; Critcher">still grossly under-represented in
						photojournalism</a>?</p>
				<p>These visualizations present marginal increases in women jurors and women photojournalist winners
					over time. One obvious question had to be explored: What type of relationship exists between women
					jurors and women winners? Does the increase in women jurors correlate to an increase in women award
					winners? Surprisingly, between 1984 and 2004, a significant interaction was not found.</p>
				<p>This suggests more complex and nuanced factors are at play and what researchers have sought to
					answer. At a theoretical level, <a
						href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2017.1282831?"
						title="Research by Westcott Campbell &amp; Critcher">what is the
						relationship between gender and how photographs are
						encoded and decoded</a>? Given
					the noticeably dominant male perspective of the world through pictures, it is natural to wonder how
					this nearly singular perspective impacts our perceptions of the world. </p>
				<p>When “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/screen/16.3.6" title="Research by Laura Mulvey, 1975">the male
						gaze</a>” is so entrenched and woven
					into the
					fabric of how <a
						href="https://medium.com/@denisavitova/why-female-photographers-still-mimic-the-male-gaze-b0a23f831773">even
						women see and interpret the world</a>,
					what impact do award-winning photographs have on how photographers continue to interpret and
					translate the world, how publishers and editors select images to be seen and ultimately, how
					communities see themselves and the world through photographs?</p>
				<p>In <em>Truth Needs No Ally: Inside Photojournalism</em>, Tom Hardin states, “news isn’t male or
					female”;
					however, the experiences a photographer brings to the making of the picture is a significant factor
					that must be considered. The totality of a photographer’s experiences is a legitimate aspect
					influencing the choices made in framing, composition, light, color, moment, and more in the making
					of an image. A photographer’s gender is part of that equation.</p>
				<p><strong>Do women see differently than men?</strong> According to researchers, a definitive answer is
					yet to be determined; however, they found that systemic obstacles for women photojournalists
					significantly diminish “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2018.1500871"
						title="Research by Adrian Hadland &amp; Camille Barnett">the
						opportunity to influence the ways in which women are perceived and view themselves</a>”.</p>
