				<!-- <p class="kicker-label">Background</p>
				<h2>What is the Pictures of the Year competition?</h2> -->
				<p class="drop"><strong>Photojournalism has gone through a seismic shift over the last
						three decades</strong>. With
					the decline of print journalism, the rise of the internet, digital cameras and cell phones,
					photojournalists have been severely impacted by these transformations. In spite of these
					circumstances, photojournalism continues to be valued and practiced around the world. Photography
					competitions
					offer a venue to honor the visual journalists and the photographs they make. <strong>Men have
						dominated the profession and competitions for years.</strong>
				</p>

				<p>Pictures of the Year, started in the spring of 1944 by Cliff Edom at the University of Missouri, is
					one of the oldest photojournalism competitions in the world. The competition
					was revered as “the Oscars of
					photojournalism”
					(Garrett, 1999).</p>
				<p>Known today as POYi (Pictures of the Year International)<sup>[1]</sup>, thousands of images are
					entered by
					visual journalists from around the world (“A Brief History of POY”, n.d.). From elections to the
					Olympics, and other major world events, the POYi competition would evolve to reflect transformations
					in society, including the technological and demographic changes in photojournalism and publishing
					outlets<sup>[2]</sup>. <strong>In recent years, the profession has become more aware of the need for
						a greater
						diversity of
						voices. So, how does the Pictures of the Year competition reflect the voices of women?</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: This is the first phase of a longer-term investigation and
					visualization of the Pictures of the Year International (POYi) archives. The findings for this phase
					are limited to the years between 1984 and 2004 and cannot be generalized for the entire competition.
					Results should be viewed and treated with caution as the data source was found to have numerous
					errors and inconsistencies in addition to missing or unknown information.

				<h2>The Jury</h2>
				<p>Well-respected scholars, photographers, editors, and designers have typically been invited to be on
					the jury. As the competition continues to evolve to reflect the industry, the jury evolves as well.
					Recruitment and selection of jury members is a subjective process and an art.
				</p>
				<p>Bill Kuykendall:</p>

				<blockquote>Every judge must be able to speak authoritatively and convincingly using specifics and not
					just feelings. My NPPA liaisons and I put a lot of effort into identifying prospective judges who
					had the right combination of professional experience as [photographers] and editors and the ability
					to articulate the virtues and shortcomings of entries. Temperament is another quality. The [panel]
					requires individuals who 'play well' with others<sup>[5]</sup>.</blockquote>

				<h2>The Photographers</h2>
				<p>For many years, photo competitions offered the rare outlet for photographers to have their work
					rewarded and recognized with the hope their work would be seen by people who hire and/or publish
					photography. Winning an award in POY tended to be a valuable stepping-stone for photographers’
					careers and could be key considerations for pay raises for staff photographers. Newspaper and
					magazine photographers also saw the Pictures of the Year competition as a way to earn respect from
					the ‘word people’ <sup>[8, 9]</sup>. As photography gained more respect, winning
					awards gave photographers more
					bragging rights and a type of fame and prestige within and out of the photojournalism community.

				<h2>The Awards</h2>
				<p>Pictures of the Year changed dramatically between 1984 and 2004. The number of entries increased
					steadily to tens of thousands and in 1987, the judging process shifted from viewing prints mounted
					on boards to viewing slides. It was a period of immense growth and change for the competition
					<sup>[10]</sup>.
					Submissions
					moved to digital and online in 2001 <sup>[11]</sup>.</p>
				<p>Winning an award from the Pictures of the Year competition offered fuel for marketing and brand value
					for organizations. According to Bill Kuykendall, “publishers saw contests as a way to
					burnish
					their
					publications’ reputation. Picture editors saw them as a way to develop and motivate their
					staff<sup>[12]</sup>”.
					The awards offered a concrete metric for directors of photography and editors to justify budgets and
					for some, increase the diversity of hiring<sup>[13]</sup>. Howard Chapnick of Black Star and Bob
					Gilka of
					<em>National
						Geographic</em> recognized the value of entering POY and other photo competitions, encouraging
					their photographers to enter and providing the time and resources to do so<sup>[14]</sup>.
					<strong>Winning gave
						organizations
						promotional capital</strong>: Their staffs were among the best visual storytellers in the world.

				<h2>Freelance Photographers</h2>
				<p>Naturally, as the more traditional model and markets for photojournalism showed signs of collapse,
					the traditional outlets for publishing photojournalism also diminished. Newspaper jobs
					have <a
						href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/employment-trends-in-newspaper-publishing-and-other-media-1990-2016.htm">declined
						dramatically since the 1990s</a>. Not surprisingly, there has
					been a <a href="https://work.chron.com/being-photographer-high-demand-22984.html">steady increase of
						freelance photographers</a> over time. Given these conditions, it would be
					natural to assume freelancers would be winning a greater percentage of awards each year.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="chart freelancetotal">
				<div class="chartExplainer">
					<h3>Percent of Award Winners <br />Who are Freelance Photographers</h3>
					<p>Between 1984 and 2004, a total of 477 awards were given to freelance photojournalists with a
						significant percentage peak in the mid-to-late 90s.</p>
				</div><!-- end chartExplainer -->
				<figure id="freelance">
				</figure>
				<div class="chartNotes">
					<p>These percentages were derived from award winners designated as freelance or
						independent. This may or may not include freelancers who were contracted by wire services or
						photo agencies. Awards associated with an agency, wire service, newspaper or magazine,
						were counted with the publishing outlets.</p>
				</div>
			</div><!-- end chart -->
			<div class="text">
				<p> Yet, beginning in 1999, the number of awards
					given to freelancers shows a decline. Why? A few possibilities:</p>
				<p><strong>After a split with the National
						Press Photographers Association (NPPA)</strong> in 2001 and for the first time in its history,
					POY charged entry fees for all entries <sup>[15, 16]</sup>.</p>
				<p><strong>2000 to
						2004 brought major world events</strong> including the dot com bubble, Enron, 9/11 terrorist
					attacks, the War on Terror, the War in Afghanistan, and several coups, conflicts and civil wars
					around the world (Barnicoat &amp; Woolf, 2009). Events considered “news” for U.S. publishing outlets
					meant sending
					photographers overseas to cover them. Resources and safety were concerns. Most freelance
					photographers did not have such resources unless contracted by major publishing outlets. It could
					be that during this time, publishing titles were devoting greater
					amounts of staff resources to major news events<sup>[17]</sup>>.
				</p>
				<p><strong>By the end of 2004, newspaper photography
						staffs were still relatively robust</strong>. Many could still count on the benefits of
					full-time
					employment while also having the resources and time to publish meaningful work<sup>[18, 19]</sup>.
					So even though 2004
					also marked the beginning of a <a
						href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/" target="_blank">sizeable
						decline in local newspapers and the appearance of news deserts</a>, the most <a
						href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2013-05-30-chi-chicago-sun-times-photo-20130530-story.html">catastrophic
						shedding of staff photographer jobs</a> was yet to occur.</p>
				<p class="disclaimer">In 2013, the Middletown (NY) Times Herald-Record laid off its entire photography
					staff (Winslow, 2013). Professors Tara Mortensen and Peter Gade (2018) provide research that "shows
					professional
					photojournalists matter, even in the age of smartphones. When newsrooms
					eliminate their photojournalism staff, it seems, they also eliminate a compelling component of
					news". <a

				<p>These visualizations present marginal increases in women jurors and women photojournalist winners
					over time. <strong>One obvious question had to be explored: What type of relationship exists between
						women
						jurors and women winners?</strong> Does the increase in women jurors correlate to an increase in
					women award
					winners? Surprisingly, between 1984 and 2004, a significant interaction was not found.</p>
				<p>This suggests more complex and nuanced factors are at play and what researchers have sought to
					answer. At a theoretical level, <a
						href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2017.1282831?"
						title="Research by Westcott Campbell &amp; Critcher">what is the
						relationship between gender and how photographs are
						encoded and decoded</a> (Westcott Campbell &amp; Critcher, 2018)? <strong>Given
						the noticeably dominant male perspective of the world through pictures, it is natural to wonder
						how
						this nearly singular perspective impacts our perceptions of the world</strong>. </p>
				<p>When “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/screen/16.3.6" title="Research by Laura Mulvey, 1975">the male
						gaze</a> (Mulvey, 1975, p.837 para.3)” is so entrenched and woven
					into the
					fabric of how <a
						href="https://medium.com/@denisavitova/why-female-photographers-still-mimic-the-male-gaze-b0a23f831773">even
						women see and interpret the world (Vitova, 2019)</a>,
					what impact do award-winning photographs have on how photographers continue to interpret and
					translate the world, how publishers and editors select images to be seen and ultimately, how
					communities see themselves and the world through photographs?</p>
				<p>In <em>Truth Needs No Ally: Inside Photojournalism</em>, Tom Hardin states, “news isn’t male or
					female” (Chapnick, 2006, p.87, para.1);
					however, the experiences a photographer brings to the making of the picture is a significant factor
					that must be considered. The totality of a photographer’s experiences is a legitimate aspect
					that influences the choices made&mdash;framing, composition, light, color, moment, and more&mdash;in
					the making
					of an image. <strong>A photographer’s gender is part of that equation</strong>.</p>
				<p><strong>Do women see differently from men?</strong> According to researchers, a definitive answer is
					yet to be determined (Hadland &amp; Barnett, 2018); however, they found that systemic obstacles for
					women photojournalists
					significantly diminish “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2018.1500871"

				<h4>Methodology</h4>
				<p>This project is a case study and the first phase of a longer-term exploration and investigation of
					the Pictures of the Year competition archives, including data about photographs entered, jurors and
					winners. Phase one digs into the data made available by the University of Missouri and the Pictures
					of the Year competition to understand the representation of women and men within the archives
					between 1984 and 2004.</p>
				<p>Why 1984 to 2004? This timeframe was a period of immense change for the competition, the publishing
					industry and systems surrounding photojournalism. It was a time when Google was in its nascency and
					before social media mushroomed. It was also a time of seismic evolution for photojournalism. Women
					made significant inroads during this time.</p>
				<p>The data for <em>Still a Man's World</em> was provided on an external hard drive by the Director of
					the
					Pictures of the Year competition. It consisted of several Excel workbooks with multiple sheets and
					thousands of low-resolution jpg image files. Many of the image files were scans from prints from the
					earlier years of the competition; others are a combination of digital files stripped of metadata or
					with metadata intact. Not all variables had recorded data and a significant portion of the data was
					either missing or unknown. Photographer names, organization names, and awards were not standardized
					and were manually cleaned using pivot tables to confirm counts.</p>
				<p>Photographer names and gender if not included in the original dataset were sourced from Google
					searches through articles, obituaries, and library archives. If a name or gender could not be
					confirmed, the data was recorded as "NA" or "Unknown". To confirm the spelling of photographer
					names, the same process was completed. Newspaper names were cross-checked using a
					combination of Google searches, Wikipedia, and the <a href="https://usnpl.com/index.php"
						target="_blank" title="Directory of U.S. newspapers">United
						States Newspaper Listing</a> website. The most recent newspaper title is used and previous
					titles due to mergers and buyouts were folded in to the current title.</p>
				<p>Cleaning data was processed using Excel through multple functions and built-in features.
					Corresponding
					image links were gathered using R. All data was merged to a master file, analyzed using pivot
					tables, and filtered as needed.</p>
				<p>Visual exploration of the data was accomplished using multiple web-based tools: <a
						href="https://flourish.studio/" target="_blank">Flourish</a>, <a
						href="https://www.datawrapper.de/" target="_blank">DataWrapper</a>,
					<a href="https://app.rawgraphs.io/" target="_blank">RawGraphs</a>, and <a
						href="http://www.data-illustrator.com/" target="_blank">Data Illustrator</a>. The use of <a
						href="https://insights.datylon.com/stories" target="_blank">Datylon</a> was also attempted. All
					charts in the final version were made using D3.js except for the small multiples chart (Gender
					breakdown in the Top 25 Publishing Outlets).</p>
