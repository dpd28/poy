				<h2>What is the Pictures of the Year competition?</h2>
				<p>Pictures of the Year, started in spring of 1944 as the First Annual Fifty-Print Exhibition by Cliff
					Edom at the University of Missouri. At the time, its purpose was “to pay tribute to those press
					photographers and newspapers which, despite tremendous war-time difficulties, are doing a splendid
					job to provide an opportunity for photographers of the nation to meet in open competition; and to
					compile and preserve… a collection of the best in current, home-front press pictures”. </p>

				<p>The next few years welcomed the beginning of a series of changes in name and scope that also mark the
					genesis of the competition’s evolution as society and the industry transformed. In 1948 the
					Fifty-Print Exhibition became the News Picture of the Year Contest when magazine photographers were
					invited to participate. When the University of Missouri and the National Press Photographers’
					Association (NPPA) merged contests in 1957, the competition became Pictures of the Year (POY). Known
					today as POYi (Pictures of the Year International), it is one of the oldest photojournalism
					contests. Thousands of images are entered by photographers from around the world. (<a
						href="https://www.poy.org/history.html">Pictures of the Year | 77th Annual Competition |
						History</a>)</p>

				<p>Reframing Photographs investigates the Pictures of the Year competition archives — photos and
					information
					about winners — between 1984 and 2004. Phase one digs into the data about the POY winners to
					understand
					the representation of women and men within the archives.</p>
				<p><strong>Why 1984 to 2004?</strong> This timeframe was a period of immense change both for the
					competition, the publishing
					industry and systems surrounding photojournalism. It was, according to Bill Garrett, former Editor
					of
					National Geographic, “the Oscars of photojournalism” (source).</p>

				<p class="disclaimer">Please note: The dataset for this project was sourced from the Pictures of the
					Year competition yet upon analysis, data was found to be missing in addition to errors and many
					inconsistencies. <strong>Not sure what else to add?</strong></p>

				<h2>The Jury</h2>
				<p>Well-respected scholars, photographers, editors, and
					designers have typically invited to be on the jury. As the competition continues to evolve to
					reflect the industry, the jury evolves as well. Recruitment and selection of jury members
					is a subjective process and an art.</p>
				<p>Bill Kuykendall:</p>

				<blockquote>Every judge must be able to speak authoritatively and convincingly using specifics and not
					just feelings. My NPPA liaisons and I put a lot of effort into identifying prospective judges who
					had the right combination of processional experience as [photographers] and editors and the ability
					to articulate the virtues and shortcomings of entries. Temperament is another quality. The [panel]
					requires individuals who 'play well' with others.</blockquote>

				<h2>The Photographers (Award Winners)</h2>
				<p>For many years, photo competitions offered the rare outlet for photographers to have their work
					rewarded and recognized with the hope their work is seen by people who hire and/or publish
					photography. Winning an award in POY tended to be a valuable stepping-stone for photographers’
					careers. Newspaper and magazine photographers also saw the Pictures of the Year competition as a way
					to earn respect from the ‘word people’ who ran their papers. As photography gained more respect,
					winning awards gave photographers more bragging rights, giving many photographers a type of fame and
					prestige within and out of the photojournalism community. Most were men, giving them more and highly
					coveted assignments and greater earning power (source?).</p>

				<h2>The Awards</h2>
				<p>Winning an award from the Pictures of the Year competition offered fuel for marketing and brand value
					for organizations. According to Bill Kuykendall, “publishers saw contests as a way to burnish their
					publications’ reputation. Picture editors saw them as a way to develop and motivate their staff”.
					Howard Chapnick of Black Star and Bob Gilka of <em>National Geographic</em> recognized the value of
					entering POY and other photo competitions, encouraging their photographers to enter and providing
					the time and resources to do so. Winning gave organizations promotional capital: Their staffs were
					among the best visual storytellers in the world. </p>
				<p>According to David Rees, the scale and scope of the Pictures of the Year changed dramatically during
					Bill Kuykendall’s tenure. The number of entries increased to tens of thousands, [increase in

				<h2>Freelance Photographers</h2>
				<p>Naturally, as the more traditional model and markets for photojournalism showed signs of collapse,
					the traditional outlets for publishing photojournalism also diminished. Full-time newspaper jobs
					have declined dramatically since the 1990s (need to add annotation). Not surprisingly, there has
					been a steady increase of freelance photographers over time. Given these conditions, it would be
					natural to assume freelancers would be winning a greater percentage of awards each year.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="chart freelancetotal">
				<div class="chartExplainer">
					<h4>Percent of Award Winners Who are Freelance Photographers</h4>
					<p>Between 1984 and 2004, a total of 477 awards were given to freelance photojournalists with a
						significant percentage peak in the mid-to-late 90s.</p>
				</div><!-- end chartExplainer -->
				<figure id="freelance">
				</figure>
				<div class="chartNotes">
					<p>These percentages were derived from award winners designated as freelance or
						independent. This may or may not include freelancers who were contracted by wire services or
						photo agencies. Awards associated with an agency, wire service, newspaper or magazine,
						were counted with the publishing outlets.</p>
				</div>
			</div><!-- end chart -->
			<div class="text">
				<p> Yet, beginning in 1999, the number of awards
					given to freelancers shows a decline. Why? A few possibilities:</p>
				<p>In 2001, after a split with the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA)
					POY started to charge entry fees for the first time in its history.</p>
				<p>2000 to
					2004 brought major world events including the dot com bubble, Enron, 9/11 terrorist attacks, the War
					on Terror, the War in Afghanistan, and several coups, conflicts and civil wars around the world.
					Events considered “news” for U.S. publishing outlets meant sending photographers overseas to cover
					them which meant resources and safety concerns. Most freelance photographers did not have such
					resources unless contracted by major publishing outlets in the U.S. or Europe. It could be during
					this time, publishing titles were devoting greater amounts of resources to major news events.</p>
				<p>Even by the end of 2004, photographers were still employed by many newspapers. Fewer than years
					before but many could still count on the benefits of full-time employment while also
					having the resources and time to publish meaningful work. </p>
				<p>So, even though 2004 also marked the beginning of a <a
						href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/" target="_blank">sizeable
						decline in local newspapers and the appearance of news deserts</a>, the most catastrophic
					shedding of staff photographer jobs began with the Great Recession.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="chart freelancegender">
				<div class="chartExplainer">
					<h4>Gender Representation of Award Winning Freelancers</h4>
					<p>Of the 477 number of awards awarded to freelancers, only 17% were won by women photographers
						between 1984 and 2004.

			<div class="text">
				<p>While the number of awards won by freelance photographers seem to have decreased between 2000 and
					2004, by all other accounts, the number of freelance photojournalists were on the rise. Research
					shows that greater numbers of freelance photojournalists are women. They also tend to be more
					educated, use a diverse set of technology but suffer financially from erratic income and
					assignments. (Source: Hadland & Barnett).

				</p>
				<p>If more
					women are freelance photographers, what are the possible reasons for the lower numbers and what is
					the impact for women in photojournalism? Do fewer women photographers enter contests? Why? Are fewer
					women photographers sent on assignment? How does the definition of “news” impact who gets assigned
					and ultimately who wins awards?</p>

				<h2>Why Are Women Still A Minority?</h2>
				<p>This glimpse into the Pictures of the Year competition reinforces what many of us already know:
					photojournalism is a male-dominated profession. It’s also safe to say women have had to confront
					circumstances, rise up to meet challenges and address societal expectations unique to their sex.
					Still, they have overcome those challenges, circumstances and expectations as well as those inherent

				<p>Given the noticeably dominant male perspective of the world through pictures and across centuries, it
					is natural to wonder how this nearly singular perspective impacts our perceptions of the world. In
					fact, researchers and practitioners alike have grappled with this question for decades in art, film,
					and more recently photojournalism. </p>
